# Neural Network

Cells into the nervous system is call neurons. The brain is a information processing system, where every information process and transmit within neuron cell. The neuron has three main part. First One is Dendrite for receiving infomation or data form another cell, Second one is nucleus for data process and last one is axon use to transmit the process data to another neuron. The neuron network approch is not differnt from a nervous system. The vision of the neural network is to try to get an appropriation of the nervous system. The neural network are also use three step. Those are input, process(hidden Layer) and Output.

In our model, The input is work alike dendrite and Out hypthesis output is like axon. There are three time of layer.  
- input Layer or Initial Layer
- Hidden Layer (Data processing units)
- Output Layer.  
In the neural network, there has a biasn unit, whihc always value is one. It's defnine as a first unit of column.
